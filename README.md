# OpenAI_Csharp_windowsForm
Class Project to create a weather based health advisor thought id play around with the OpenAI GPT api alongside OpenWeatherAPI. 
Im using davinci-002 model but i want to use gpt turbo 3.5 when it is available for c# windows form.

You will probaly have to install the nuget packages: Jsonsoft, RestSharp, OpenAI.
You will need your own OpenAI Apt Key & OpenWeather Api Key

#note#
I believe OpenAI havent released there own Nuget but there is a wrapper that works info: https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenAI/
You should set up limit on your OpenAI account so you dont accidently rack up a huge bill from openAI. 
When writing my code ive been using the free $18 of tokens i have currently ive only spent $0.04 to make this.
